\begin{problem}{Anti-hash Test}{\textsl{standard input}}{\textsl{standard output}}{1 second}{256 mebibytes}

It is well-known that the following string $s(n) = s_0 s_1 \ldots s_{2^n-1}$ can challenge almost every solution that uses polynomial hashes modulo $2^{64}$: 

$$
s_i = \begin{cases}
\text{``\texttt{a}''}, & \mathrm{popcount}(i) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
\text{``\texttt{b}''}, & \mathrm{popcount}(i) \bmod 2 = 1
\end{cases}
$$
where $\mathrm{popcount}(i)$ means the number of ones in binary representation of number $i$.

Given a string $u$ and an integer $n$, find the number of occurrences of $u$ in string $s(n)$ and the number of distinct strings $v$ which have the same number of occurrences in string $s(n)$. As both the numbers may be very large, you are only asked to calculate them modulo $10^9 + 7$.

\InputFile
There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$).

The second line contains a string $u$ ($1 \le |u| \le \min(10^6, 2^n)$) consisting only of letters ``\texttt{a}'' and ``\texttt{b}''.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $|u|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.


\OutputFile
For each test case, if the string $u$ does not appear in string $s(n)$, you should simply output $-1$. Otherwise, output two integers denoting the the number of occurrences of $u$ in string $s(n)$ modulo $10^9 + 7$ and the number of distinct strings $v$ which have the same number of occurrences in string $s(n)$ modulo $10^9 + 7$.
