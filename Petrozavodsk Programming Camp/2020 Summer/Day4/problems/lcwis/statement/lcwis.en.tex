\begin{problem}{Longest Common Subsequence}{\textsl{standard input}}{\textsl{standard output}}{2 seconds}{256 mebibytes}

Chiaki has two sequences $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$. She would like to find their longest common subsequence $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k$ such that $c_1 \le c_2 \le \ldots \le c_k$.

\InputFile
There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^6$): the lengths of two sequences.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 3$).

The third line contains $m$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$ ($1 \le b_i \le 3$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $\max\{n,m\}$ in all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.


\OutputFile
For each test case, output a single integer $k$: the length of the longest common subsequence $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k$ such that $c_1 \le c_2 \le \ldots \le c_k$.
